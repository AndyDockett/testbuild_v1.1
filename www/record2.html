    <p >Martin von Haller glances at his pedometer. It's 10 a.m., and so far he has taken 3,137 steps since he stepped out of bed. He has worn the pedometer constantly for two years. He has left it behind on a belt a few times and then been plagued by a guilty conscience.<br>
      <br>
      Von Haller is part of the international movement Quantified Self. The people behind the concept claim that we can gain improved insight into ourselves and change our behaviour by continually measuring our actions. Quantified Self meetings are held in about 50 cities across the world. Data enthusiasts gather to share their own data discoveries — how they have improved their sleep by amassing statistics on their sleep patterns over several months, how they have improved their concentration by photographing all meals and recording what supplied the most energy for their bodies. Some even attempt to improve their mental condition by tracking their mood daily.<br>
                                    
      Gary Wolf, a contributing editor at Wired Magazine, founded Quantified Self in 2007. He noticed how we constantly generate data as we surf the web, via our cell phones and other technologies, but that corporations were the primary beneficiaries of all this information. He argued that people themselves should collect data for private use.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class='cyan uppercase'>Individual responsibility</strong><br>
      Martin von Haller, a Dane, was originally introduced to Quantified Self after being diagnosed with diabetes and therefore had to be more conscious of diet and exercise. He records his steps and his sleep patterns and considers self-tracking a natural step up the ladder of technological evolution.<br>
                                    
      Personally, I'm extremely motivated by recording every step around the clock. In the late morning, I can see how far I am in relation to my daily average of 10 kilometres. Then I know how much I have to optimize and how I can plan my steps the rest of the day. He believes that the explosion of data not only gives him more bits of information as an individual, but that self-tracking can also cause structural changes in society. Von Haller suspects that people would get more personal treatment by their doctors if patients with heart problems could document how much they have eaten and exercised, instead of just making an unreliable guess. He believes that research would gain more parameters for measurement, and that the healthcare sector could potentially cut costs, because the responsibility rests with each Quantified Self user, not with the state or physicians.<br>
  <br>
  <strong class='cyan uppercase'>The obligation in liberation</strong><br>
      But why would you measure your intake of calories, why try to track your mood and your sleep patterns? Can't you just trust your feelings and your ability to reflect without having to register every step you take?<br>
  <br>
      Von Haller answers: I believe it raises your awareness to attempt to measure it objectively. People might feel that they have exercised a lot without it being true. Individuals gain control by gathering their own data. I don't have to ask my doctor about my health, I can measure a lot myself, he says.<br>
  <br>
      Self-tracking has its challenges, though. One the one hand, it's up for discussion whether you can actually measure your own mood; on the other hand, self-trackers talk about outright data neurosis — a state in which exaggerated tracking completely dominates people's behaviour. Von Haller does not believe that his measurements of sleep, exercise and steps have gotten out of control, but when on vacation on the Canary Islands, he jumped in the pool with the pedometer on, and his constant companion expired. I had been training intensely for a week and had improved my average, and then the pedometer drowned. I was really bummed out that all my improved data had disappeared, he says.<br>
                                    
      He points to 'the paradox of choice' as either the most important or the worst consequence of data collection, depending how you look at it.<br>
                                    
      The self-regulation that Quantified Self makes possible is a liberation, but also an obligation, von Haller believes. The records can place a person under existential pressure. It becomes so obvious that you are responsible for everything you do when you measure it all the time. It becomes clear that your obesity is not the fault of the local authorities, God or fate. It's your own fault.<br>
