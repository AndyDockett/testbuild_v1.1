                                   <p> If the world hatched another Adolf Hitler tomorrow, a small country like Denmark would in many ways be the perfect place for carrying out his brand of persecution of specific populations; the Danish state is a registration state which registers its inhabitants systematically from cradle to grave. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>And it does this so meticulously and comprehensively that Danes are the most registered population in the world, according to Peter Lauritsen, who is writing a history of the personal identification number and researches surveillance at the Department of Information and Media Science at Aarhus University.
                                     
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The state has exhaustive knowledge of its citizens, and the comprehensive registration makes it possible to draw up an alarmingly precise profile of the entire Danish population, he says. 
        
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The volumes of data create coherence in a thoroughly regulated welfare state like the Danish, where corruption, abuse of power and suppression of specific populations are a far cry from reality. But what if the democratic government suddenly turned evil and totalitarian? We've played with the idea and asked Lauritsen to lead us through this frightening thought experiment, in which the data falls into the wrong hands and the state turns against its citizens.
        
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>A key to the registration state</h2>
      </p>
      <p>When a child is born in Denmark, one of the first things that happens is the assignment of a personal identification number in the civil register. For the rest of the child's life, the identity number acts as the key to various registers that continuously store information about every resident.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> The list of state registers containing information about Danes is a long one. Everything is recorded, from current and former addresses to illnesses and unemployment, financial status and religious affiliation. Some registers are hidden from individual citizens, while others are open, enabling people to log on and see their entire medical history from the day they were born, including all doctors' visits, operations and prescriptions. The system of registration has many advantages, but also one significant vulnerability:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> If a totalitarian regime suddenly gains power and the state turns evil, the combination of a personal identification number and the many registers would make it very easy to single out specific subgroups of the population. The regime might, for example, hone in on persons with certain diseases, persons with a certain lifestyle — and to the extent that it has been registered — persons with certain political views, explains Lauritsen.        </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>The nightmare scenario</h2>
      <p>
        Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany on April 9, 1940, and the hunt for Jews began in Denmark as in the rest of Europe. The personal identification number and the CRS weren't introduced until 1968, but had they been in effect when the Germans occupied the country, Danish Jews would have most likely been more easily located. The Germans could have extracted names and addresses of all Danish citizens registered in Jewish synagogues, or they might have traced all Danes circumcised by the health services.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      An evil regime headed by an insane dictator could similarly use the registers in a systematic purge or deportation of populations with certain diseases, as Kim Jong-Il did in North Korea in 1989, when he exiled all of one town's disabled to uninhabited islands. Or as Pol Pot did during the 1970s in Cambodia, or as Hitler did in the so-called Aktion T4, in which more than 100,000 physically and mentally disabled people were killed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> In Denmark, a new dictator with a similar agenda could target people born with deformities, who are registered in the so-called Register of Congenital Malformations; mentally ill persons registered in The Psychiatric Central Research Register, or disabled people or people with a history of suicide in the family.      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It's a frightening scenario — and compared to other countries, the scope of registration is in fact unique to Denmark. In Germany, where the population has experienced classification, surveillance and persecution by the Nazis and later in the GDR, the shadows of the past loom large in the present, making a similar kind of registration unthinkable.        </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In many other countries, authorities would never be able to introduce a personal identification number system like the Danish one. The population always fears what the state might do if it gets too powerful and collects too much information about its citizens, Lauritsen says.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> In Britain, the fear of a state with too much knowledge of its citizens rears its head at regular intervals. Identity cards for residents were abolished after World War II, but in the new millennium, the political debate about whether to once again assign inhabitants a number has raged for years. The identity card would include general personal information such as name, birth date, sex and address — but it goes against the British interpretation of civil rights and has met heavy resistance. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>The state has our best interests at heart      </h2>
     
      <p>Lauritsen believes that the sceptical view of registration in most other countries is rooted in a relationship to the state that is radically different than the one prevalent in Scandinavia. Whereas state and population are viewed as separate entities in many other countries, this attitude is a thing of the past in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. 
        </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Today, the Danish population and the state exist in an almost symbiotic relationship. Danes fundamentally believe that the state is good and has our best interests at heart — and that's why they are not worried about the identification number and the many registers," says Lauritsen. "Sure, we think, in principle the state is able to collect lots of information about us — but if it does, it's probably for the benefit of everyone.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The symbiotic relationship is manifest in the fact that Danes not only are the most registered people in the world, but also the most trusting. Year after year, Denmark tops the list in international studies that measure both citizens' trust in each other and in institutions such as courts, the government and the civil administration.
      </p>
      <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
      <h2>Part of the infrastructure
      </h2>
      <p>When the CRS was introduced in 1968, its primary purpose was to gain control of the growing Danish welfare state. The point of the welfare state was tasking the state with assuring citizens' welfare and security through free access to healthcare and education, among other things. But security did not come cheap, and the state began collecting large sums in taxes and fees. The introduction of income tax in particular, required that the state always knew where people worked and lived. With the miraculous arrival of computerization, it was possible to make detailed registrations that different authorities could share. 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With time the personal identification number and the many registers have become an integral part of society, and of all of us. They are the invisible glue that holds the welfare state together.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Danes can't imagine themselves without this number. A person simply can't get a foothold in society without it, and the CRS system has become as important a part of the Danish infrastructure as roads and bridges, Lauritsen explains.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Comprehensive legislation assures that it actually would take a totalitarian dictator to use the registration for suppressing or purging parts of the population. 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In realistic terms, the coming of the evil registration state is far from imminent. The state could, if it really wanted to, combine the registers with very little effort. Increasingly, for example, this is what happens when the state pursues welfare fraud, Lauritsen says.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> The stronger the interest in welfare cheats, the more municipalities will begin to merge registers, Lauritsen says. 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>But these mergers could be used for many other things, if the municipalities were interested — and in that perspective, this is just one example of how the state could really discover something about each and every citizen if it wanted to.
