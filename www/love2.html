Mathematical calculations can now show us where to find our one and only. Absorb Magazine tests the effect and goes on a date.</h1>
		<article class='small'>

			<p>They say that love is the one thing that money can't buy. But perhaps this is not entirely true anymore: More than ever, dating sites sell us the possibility of meeting the right one. Globally, such sites generated sales of four billion dollars last year, and in order to get a bigger slice of the pie they constantly refine the methods for finding the right one. Today this means that dating sites use algorithms to identify your one and only. Love has become a number.</p>
			<p>An algorithm is an advanced mathematical calculation that uses the power of computers to draw conclusions and calculate results that go beyond human understanding — and to find love, it seems. Precisely how the algorithms manage to locate that one right match remains a business secret — also at matchaffinity.dk, the Danish version of the largest US dating site match.com. This is where I will try my luck.</p>
			<h2>YOU LOOK LIKE MY MOTHER</h2>
			<p>It's an appealing thought: We could spare ourselves many exertions and late nights, if someone told us beforehand who we would click with. I have a horrible memory of a night in a hip bar, when some guy in a lumberjack shirt tried
			to impress me by saying he knew the drummer in the band. And the bass player. Then there was the guy who tried to pay me a compliment by saying that I looked like his mother, when she was at their summer cottage. When I laughed, he added that I had a very masculine laugh. I gave him a wrong phone number. I have a partner these days, but I take the personality test just for the sake of experiment.</p>
			<p>It has 97 questions: Am I interested in a adventurous, considerate or ambitious man? What would I say if my partner is wearing the wrong clothes? Am I into experimental or traditional sex? Am I frugal or extravagant? What is my view on spoiling children and what is my relationship with my parents?</p>
			<p>My best match (75 percent) is a 30-year- old man from suburban Herlev who starts off his profile with this: “I might
			be able to compete with your shoe collection. I have a lot, and I mean a lot. But most of them are running shoes
			;o)”. I remain skeptical. The runner-up (72 percent) is a 30-year-old 'managing executive' from the Danish capital. Third place (68 percent) goes to a 28-year- old pre-school teacher from the city of Ringsted. I write to them, asking if they want to go on a date and 'test the test'.</p>
			<p>None of them want to meet. I send all my data to the editorial staff instead, and they find a guy among their acquaintances who has a similar score on the match test and who wants to meet. He is Johannes Kaas Fallesen, 26. We have a 66 percent match rate and go on a date.</p>
			<h2>NATURAL LOVE DETECTOR</h2>
			<p>Critics of love algorithms say such a date is more or less futile. The accuracy of the algorithms has never been
			proven scientifically, they maintain. Eli Finkel, a professor of social psychology at Northwestern University in Illinois recently published a report with several other scientists, raising doubts about the notion that a personality test and and algorithm can show the way. “Technology is not the way to figure out who is compatible and will never be,” he said last April to The New York Times. “At the end of the day, the human algorithm
			— neural tissue in our cranium called a brain — has evolved over a long period
			of time to size up people efficiently. On a blind date, a person arrives and in that instant I can say I’m glad I did this or regret it.”</p>
			<h2>RED SHOES</h2>
			<p>The first thing I notice about my blind date are his red Converse sneakers.
			My sister owns a pair just like this, and
			I immediately think: womanish. Apart from that, he looks cute and sympathetic as he stands there by the coffee counter, a little anxious about the situation. He's a bit shorter than I am, making me think that the odds are against our happiness.</p>
			<p>It's my, and his, first blind date. And he's skeptical, he explains as we sit down, each with a cup of black coffee: “I don't believe you can generate statistics or percentages about something like love. It removes all the suspense. It would
			be really boring if you knew everything about each other through the personality test. You would have nothing to talk about,” he says.<br>
			Let's put it to the test.</p>
			<h2>THE ONE AND ONLY IS YOUR MIRROR IMAGE</h2>
			<p>American anthropologist Helen Fisher has made it her life's work to study why we fall in love, why some relationships last a lifetime and others end abruptly. She places infatuated and heart-broken people in an MRI scanner, and concludes in her book Why We Love: We fall in love with people who resemble us — socially, ethnically, religiously, academically and financially. The Greek Narcissus, who fell in love with his own mirror image, did not live in vain.</p>
			<p>This should make it easy for an algorithm to identify compatible people. However, it also reveals a serious source of errors: Do we really know what we want from a future partner? The US site match.com has developed an algorithm that takes the user's lack of self-insight into account. The list of matches is adjusted according to the behavior of the user. If you state in the personality test that you are turned on by well- educated men of average build, but
			only click on the profiles of muscular laborers, the algorithm will detect this and suggest more laborers for you.</p>
			<h2>CHECKMARKS</h2>
			<p>Back at the coffee bar, Johannes fortunately does not see my 'controlling' label as something negative. “If
			that means you can make your own decisions, that's great.” I go down the checklist as we talk: We both prefer dives, we don't like things to be too well- planned, he's not a miser, we both want children, we both volunteer at summer camps for kids, we both prefer a partner with ambitions. He abhors romantic comedies, however, especially those with Hugh Grant. Romantic comedies always make me cry, especially those with Hugh Grant. But as Johannes points out: “That means we have something
			to argue about without it getting too serious.” We are both journalists, which automatically gives us something to talk about. Coffee turns into a beer, and two afternoon hours have been filled with laughter and discussion. When we part, we agree that we could go on a second date. Do the many similarities mean that matchaffinity can actually work as Cupid's arrow — or are they just a matter of chance, a result of us having friends and environment in common?</p>
			<h2>THE DREAM</h2>
			<p>Meanwhile, thousands of singles continue their search for true love online, and dating sites constantly launch
			new technologies with an even higher rate of success. The latest novelty is
			an attempt to get more reality into the calculations by way of the smartphone. You carry it with you on the street and into bars, and thus the calculations of the algorithm are integrated with reality. The goal of this Augmented Reality is
			to enable you to scan a room with your phone and identify the people who have dating site profiles. On the screen a
			little box pops up over their heads with their match percentage. Guy in the blue jacket = 82 percent, blond guy at the table to the right = 52 percent, etc. I myself worked with my current partner for a year without any sparks flying. It took a week's spontaneous camping
			trip to Finnish Lapland before my brain discovered that we were very compatible. For a year my true love had been there right before my eyes, while I spent my nights at various bars. It might have been easier if I just could have scanned him in the canteen during my lunch break.</p>
